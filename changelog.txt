v0.92
- accidentally left PS2 pressure sensitive mode (WIP) enabled. Disabled now.

v0.91
- I built a second adapter and found some differences in the timings affecting PSX controllers, probably due to some slight hardware differences (stray capacitance, crystal tolerance etc.)
- adjusted all PSX timings to hopefully be more robust against slight changes in clock timings and delays etc.
- changed button mappings in Normal Mode and Arcade Mode for all supported controllers to be more consistent, new mappings:

	button 1: bottom button (SNES B, PSX Cross, NES A, NeoGeo A, Genesis A), 
	button 2: left button (SNES Y, PSX Square, NES B, NeoGeo B, Genesis B), 
	button 3: upper button (SNES X, PSX Triangle, NeoGeo C, Genesis C)
	button 4: right button (SNES A, PSX Circle, Neogeo D, Genesis X)
	button 5: Misc 1 (PSX L1, Genesis Y, N64 Yellow Left), 
	button 6: Misc 2 (PSX R1, Genesis Z, N64 Yellow Right),
	button 7: Left Shoulder (PSX L2)
	button 8: Right Shoulder (PSX R2)
	button 9: Select
	button 10: Start
	button 11: Misc 3 (PSX L3) 
	button 12: Misc 4 (PSX R3)

v0.9
- added some stubs for PS2 pressure sensitive button support, but disabled them all because the pressure sensitive buttons were sluggish and seemingly useless.
- slightly adjusted timing and psx order bit writes vs. clock pulses to remove random bitflip every few seconds on NegCon pad L button.

- adjusted PSX timing again to eliminate one last bitflip that occured every few seconds on the NegCon L button.

v0.8
- slight tweak to psx clock delay to make it work with PS2 controllers. 

v0.7
-finally made my own PSX adapter cable so I can debug PSX controllers. I found and fixed jitter problems with the original RetroAdapter communication code between adapter and PSX controller. The bytes were read almost half a PSX clock cycle after the supposed readout time on clk rising edge. This lead to jitter effects, where some buttons occasionally flickered off and on even if pressed down continously. Due to this, the vertical axis of the left analog stick also wasn't as accurate as it could have been. The Xbox controller tester for Xbox classic was an invaluable tool and shows such problems very clearly. All those problems should be completely fixed now.

-flipped NeGCon x-axis direction to conform to what happens in WipeOut on a real PSX: moving the right half of the controller away from the player steers the vehicle to the right. This means axis value 0xFF corresponds to the right direction, consistent with all other PSX controllers. This is contrary to what some sources on the web say.

v0.6
some problems with NegCon fixed in both Xbox and PC Mode.

v0.5
- finally figured out the real reason why Android did not work with reported axis values of -128: the usb descriptor in the original Mojo code incorrectly sets the min to -127, but then frequently uses -128 as a value. Windows seems to ignore this discrepancy, but Android is more picky. This is now fixed in the correct way: the axis range for x,y,rx,ry is always -128...127 as it should be, and the minimum is correctly defined in the USB Descriptor. Tested in Android on NVidia Shield and it works.
- Fixed a few bugs for some controllers in XBox Mode (sometimes, a button would be pressed always together with x or y-axis, etc.
- Changed NegCon support for PC: when Negcon is detected, three extra sliders are added to the joystick, those represent the three analog buttons of the NegCon. They go from 0 to 255. The rx, ry axis are removed in NegCon mode, because they went from -128 to 127 instead which did not make sense for analog buttons.
- added the ability to send USB reports with length >8 bytes. This is currently only used for NegCon, but opens the way for other controllers with more analog buttons.

v0.4
added NegCon support. L is mapped to upper-half vertical axis on Windows for lack of another analog axis.

V0.3
fixed some more problems with Android and N64/GC pads and PSX analog sticks. The Retroadapter was still sending -128 values for some axes for some controllers, which Android does not like.

V0.2
fixed directions being constantly pressed in Xbox mode with Atari/NeoGeo controllers

V0.1
first release
