v0.5
- finally figured out the real reason why Android did not work with reported axis values of -128:
the usb descriptor in the original Mojo code incorrectly sets the min to -127, but then frequently uses -128 as a value. Windows seems to ignore this discrepancy, but Android is more picky.
This is now fixed in the correct way: the axis range for x,y,rx,ry is always -128...127 as it should be, and the minimum is correctly defined in the USB Descriptor. Tested in Android on NVidia Shield and it works.
- Fixed a few bugs for some controllers in XBox Mode (sometimes, a button would be pressed always together with x or y-axis, etc.
- Changed NegCon support for PC: when Negcon is detected, three extra sliders are added to the joystick, those represent the three analog buttons of the NegCon. They go from 0 to 255. The rx, ry axis are removed in NegCon mode, because they went from -128 to 127 instead which did not make sense for analog buttons.
- added the ability to send USB reports with length >8 bytes. This is currently only used for NegCon, but opens the way for other controllers with more analog buttons.

v0.4
added NegCon support. L is mapped to upper-half vertical axis on Windows for lack of another analog axis.

V0.3

fixed some more problems with Android and N64/GC pads and PSX analog sticks. The Retroadapter was still sending -128 values for some axes for some controllers, which Android does not like.



V0.2
fixed directions being constantly pressed in Xbox mode with Atari/NeoGeo controllers

V0.1
first release
